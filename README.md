# Flutter application.

Kudamalana (pvt) Ltd is a Tea Factory which is situated in Downsouth Sri Lanka, and it produces Orthodox low-grown black tea. All the factory management processes were manually functioned.

We developed the Orthodox Tea Production and Purchasing Tracking System with two separate mobile applications to record daily tea purchases and processings, and as well as a web application to support managerial decision.

The mobile applications are specifically designed for Factory officers and Field agents. These two mobile applications perform different functionalities of their own as per the user's privilege level. The web application is designed only for the managers and the admin level of the tea factory.

This is the application which is used by factory officers.
